We have a simple application with an home screen, where you can choose to display images in 4 different modes: 
-Random image by breed; (there is a button for every type of view)
-Images list by breed;
-Random image by breed and sub breed;
-Images list by breed and sub breed.
To implements this functionalities I used two screens:
-random dog images screen; (where I show one random dog for his breed or for his breed and his sub breed);
-dogs list screen (where I show all dogs by breed or by breed and sub breed).
I used the https://dog.ceo/dog-api API to get all data, I first load all breed and sub breed and after load images.
